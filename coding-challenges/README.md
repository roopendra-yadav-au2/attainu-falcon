# Challenge 1 - Looping through an array

Consider the following array: 
```js
var players = [
{ name: "Roger Federer", rank: 1 },
{ name: "Rafel Nadal", rank: 2 },
{ name: "Nalbandian", rank: 12 },
{ name: "Andy Murray", rank: 14 },
{ name: "Andy Roddick", rank: 4 },
{ name: "Pete Sampras", rank: 3 },
{ name: "Rod Laver", rank: 190 },
{ name: "Andre Agassi", rank: 11 },
{ name: "Novak Djokovic", rank: 5 },
{ name: "Arthur Ashe", rank: 8 },
];
```

Write a `for` loop that only prints players with rank less than or equal to 10.
